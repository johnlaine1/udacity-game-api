1. Additional properties that I added to my models and why.


User.score:
    This keep a running total score of all games played by the user.

Game.history:
    This keeps a JSON representation of all 'Guesses' and 'Results' for
    a game.

Game.score:
    This keeps track of the score for a game.

Game.current_solution:
    This holds the portion of the 'secret word' that the user has already
    guessed.

Game.secret_word:
    This is the 'secret word' that the user is trying to guess.

Game.letters_guessed:
    This contains a string of all the letters that have already been guessed,
    both the correct and incorrect. This is used to prevent the user from
    guessing the same letter twice.

Game.cancelled:
    This is a boolean to indicate whether a game has been cancelled.




2. Some of the struggles that I faced when implementing the new game logic.


Deciding when to use a ResourceContainer vs a Message:
    I understand that ResourceContainers are used when you have url or query
    parameters and Messages are used for request parameters but I did not
    really know when I should send a parameter as a query string, a url
    component or as part of the request object.


Deciding how much of the logic to keep in the endpoint handlers vs the models.

Figuring out how to store and retrieve the current_solution and letters_guessed.

Converting history from a dictionary to a JSON object and back again in order to
stor and retrieve from the database.
